## Footnote

Payments volume, including Visa Direct volume, represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume for the relevant period, and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks, but excludes proprietary PLUS volume.  Total volume represents payments and cash volume.

Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa's signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.

The data presented is based on transactions processed by Visa and reported by Visa's financial institution clients on their operating certificates. Estimates may be utilized if data is unavailable. Due to Visa's suspension of operations in Russia in March 2022, the data no longer includes volumes and transactions for Russia clients starting the three months ended June 30, 2022 and accounts and cards starting the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates, if any, are not material.

Visa's CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. International includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA, Europe and LAC.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported ('Nominal USD').  These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter.  To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash vo lume on the basis of local currency information ('Constant USD'). This presentation represents Visa's historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.

Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. The totals and percentages are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
