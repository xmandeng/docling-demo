- (1) AT&amp;amp;T Inc. does not disclose postpaid net account additions. Comcast and Charter do not disclose postpaid phone net customer additions. Industry-leading claims are based on consensus expectations if results are not yet reported.
- (2) Core Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures tables. We are not able to forecast Net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect Net income, including, but not limited to, Income tax expense and Interest expense. Core Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict Net income as the difference between this measure and Net income is variable.
- (3) Effective November 1, 2024, following amendments to the company's Equipment Installment Plan Sale and Service Receivable Sale arrangements, all cash proceeds associated with the sale of such receivables, a portion of which was previously recognized as Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions within investing cash flows, were recognized as operating cash flows. These amendments did not have a net impact on Adjusted Free Cash Flow.

## Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)

This Investor Factbook includes non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below. T-Mobile is not able to forecast Net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income, including, but not limited to, Income tax expense and Interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict Net income, as the difference between either of these measures and Net income is variable.

Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to Net income as follows:

(1) Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the merger with Sprint Corporation (the 'Sprint Merger') have been included in Sprint Merger-related costs (gain), net.

(2) Sprint Merger-related costs (gain), net, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, includes the $100 million gain recognized for the extension fee previously paid by DISH associated with the license purchase agreement for 800 MHz spectrum licenses, which was not purchased.

(3) UScellular Merger-related costs generally include pre-merger consulting and legal fees.

(4) Legal-related expenses (recoveries), net, consists of the settlement of certain litigation and compliance costs associated with the August 2021 cyberattack and is presented net of insurance recoveries.

(5) Other, net, primarily consists of certain severance, restructuring and other expenses, gains and losses, not directly attributable to the Sprint Merger or UScellular Merger, which are not reflective of T-Mobile's core business activities and are, therefore, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA.

## Financial &amp;amp; Operational Tables

## Definitions of Terms

Operating and financial measures are utilized by T-Mobile's management to evaluate its operating performance and, in certain cases, its ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define measures in precisely the same way, T-Mobile believes the measures facilitate key operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry to provide management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate past performance and assist in forecasting future performance.

1. Account - A billing account number that generates revenue. Postpaid accounts generally consist of customers that are qualified for postpaid service utilizing phones, 5G broadband modems, fiber connections, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT, where they generally pay after receiving service.
2. Customer - A SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Customers are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, 5G broadband modems, fiber connections, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance of receiving service.
3. Churn - The number of customers whose service was deactivated as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. The number of customers whose service was deactivated is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time.
4. Postpaid Average Revenue Per Account ('ARPA') -Average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. Postpaid service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid accounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period.

Average Revenue Per User ('ARPU') - Average monthly service revenue earned per customer. Service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period.

Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues.

- Service revenues - Postpaid, including handset insurance, prepaid, wholesale and other service revenues.

1. Cost of services - Costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of T-Mobile's network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.

- Cost of equipment sales - Costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.
- Selling, general and administrative expenses - Costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include all commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense and administrative support activities.

1. Net income margin - Net income divided by Service revenues.
2. Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and Special Items. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by T-Mobile's management, including our chief operating decision maker, to monitor the financial performance of our operations and allocate resources of the Company as a whole. T-Mobile historically used Adjusted EBITDA and T-Mobile currently uses Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate its personnel and management for their performance. T-Mobile uses Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate its operating performance in comparison to competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of T-Mobile's ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of Interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation and Special Items. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the company's device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the related depreciation expense on leased devices, which is excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Income from operations, Net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ('GAAP').
3. Special Items - Certain expenses, gains, and losses which are not reflective of our ongoing performance. Special Items include Sprint Merger-related costs (gain), net, UScellular Merger-related costs, certain legal-related recoveries and expenses, restructuring costs not directly attributable to the Sprint Merger or UScellular Merger (including severance), and other non-core gains and losses.
4. Adjusted EBITDA margin and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin - Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin are nonGAAP financial measures utilized by T-Mobile's management, including our chief operating decision maker, to monitor the financial performance of our operations and allocate resources of the Company as a whole.
5. Net cash provided by operating activities margin - Net cash provided by operating activities margin is calculated as Net cash provided by operating activities divided by Service revenues.
6. Adjusted Free Cash Flow - Net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of tower sites and proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is utilized by T-Mobile's management, investors, and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business.
7. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin - Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Service revenues. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin is utilized by T-Mobile's management, investors, and analysts to evaluate the company's ability to convert service revenue efficiently into cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business.
